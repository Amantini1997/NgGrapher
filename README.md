# Grapher.js
Grapher.js is a website that provided the tools to create animation of algorithms and data structures.


So far, it only allows array-like data structures and algorithms than can be modelled around it.


## Build the software

Before running the software the first time it is necessary to call `npm install`.

To start the software, run `npm start` and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

However, the project is still active and more data structures are in progress.
